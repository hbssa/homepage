  bio: |
    Anya grew up across 12 states in the US, but calls Chicago home. 
    She worked in e-commerce, investment banking, and consulting pre-HBS. 
    She is excited for spring to finally get here so she can continue pursuing her cycling passion, 
    and she is always up for a sushi excursion. She loves dark chocolate, and can win any hula hoop challenge 
    (she won school-wide in 4th grade!). 
    Anya is excited for the upcoming year, 
    so please feel free to reach out for any ideas or suggestions to make the SA better.

    From out of the northern suburbs of Chicago, Brad spent time at BCG and at PepsiCo. 
    He believes in the value of family and wants to be the best friend and older brother 
    to his brother and sister. In his free time you can find him on the flag football field, 
    and until a few years ago, consumed at least two milkshakes per day. 
    Brad's goal for the year is to help make HBS a true home for the entire student body. 
    Don't be a stranger on campus!

    Although Cambridge is Caroline's current home, her heart will always be in the great state of Maine. 
    Before HBS, she was an administrator at a network of charter schools. 
    So whipping up an informative bulletin board or breaking up a food 
    fight in the cafeteria are pieces of cake for her! 
    You'll never see her without a Diet Coke, 
    and she will most likely have a good fiction book recommendation if you need one. 
    Caroline is excited about this upcoming year, so grab some ice cream and have a chat 
    with the new SA Chief Operating Officer!

    Brittany grew up near the Happiest Place on Earth (Disney World) and the Kennedy Space Center in sunny Florida.

    She is also really into college sports and fantasy football. 
    One of Brittany's goals this year is to complete a triathalon, 
    but since she is such a klutz - please help her if you see her fall on campus!

    means to finance every small business in the world. Jon is excited to be a part of the 
    SA to create a forum for dialogue about difficult topics with the ultimate goal of 
    building a more inclusive community.
