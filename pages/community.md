## Community

Whether it's the first day of START or the last day of Bridges, we want HBS to feel like home; and part of making a good home is belonging to a strong community.  We believe community programming should provide an opportunity for students to meet others from different sections, different years, and different backgrounds.  Community programming should offer students the opportunity to engage in casual wind-down events, to bring out their fun side, to push themselves to challenge their point of view, and to be adventurous - getting off-campus and into Boston.  

This year, the team hopes to build on traditional programming, while adding new events that cater to the diverse interests of the student body.  In addition to classic events such as TGIFs, we will host pub nights in the Grille, town-hall discussions to tackle the most challenging topics facing our generation, small group excursions throughout the city, and many other events.  Our goal is to create a supportive, fun, and engaging community that makes every student feel at home.
