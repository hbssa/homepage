<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>
  The yearâ€™s mission is to make HBS a HOME to our 1,800+ students, partners, and families.
  We will achieve this objective through specific measures underscoring:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>(H)</strong> mental <strong>health</strong> and wellness;<br>
  <strong>(O)</strong> <strong>openness</strong> and diversity;<br>
  <strong>(M)</strong> personal and career <strong>mentorship</strong>; and <br> 
  <strong>(E)</strong> affordable and on-campus <strong>engagement</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This HOME, like any other, can only be as strong as the family members (our students and their families) who comprise it. Our initiatives are dynamic, not static, and we will rely on you and your feedback to keep us on task. We look forward to working with you and cannot wait to show you the events and programming we have in store!
