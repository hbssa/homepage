## Wellness

Our goal is to make wellness and well-being a natural and seamless part of everyday life at HBS, and beyond. 
We aim to help students maximize their MBA experience according to their own true interests 
by enabling a culture that is inclusive, promotes health and well-being and supports deeper relationships. 

Over the coming year we will focus on six levers: 

1. mental well-being
2. physical health
3. self awareness and personal development
4. meaningful relationships
5. academic support
6. inclusive culture 

We will partner with Student Academic Services (SAS), Shad Hall, The Center for Wellness at Harvard, student leadership and many others to better promote existing resources within each of these areas as well as support and leverage student feedback to improve the quality of wellness-based programming.
